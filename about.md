I am currently a master's student in Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University, with a concentration on Financial Engineering. I am also an incoming Summer Intern (2022) at the quantitative strategy team at Credit Suisse NYC. 

I received my Diploma in Financial Engineering in 2021 from Nanjing University (NJU), China. During my undergraduate study, I pursued all possible opportunities to develop multiple discipline knowledge and gained maturity in mathematics, statistics, CS, and finance. Besides mastering Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Mathematical Statistics, I further grasped stochastic models such as Markov Chain and Brownian motion by excelling in Stochastic Process. It was my Financial Engineering course that enlightened me on the derivatives, non-arbitrage theory, and pricing models, and inspired my interest in probing into the linkage between finance and quantitative methods. Besides, I have also developed strong programming skills by taking multiple demanding CS courses from UC Berkeley, Harvard, and NJU, completing several academic projects involved with complex data structure, algorithm design, machine learning, and deep learning. 

I have developed critical problem-solving and innovative thinking skills during my internships. I worked as a derivatives strategy research assistant during the summer of 2021, where I helped the portfolio manager monitor and analyze the performance of invested derivatives-based funds. Drawing upon my quantitative and finance knowledge, I applied a variety of statistical methods to experiment with market and fund data. I have also been interned at Huatai Securities and China Merchants Bank Wealth Management, working on fund evaluation and factor construction. 

I have always been very passionate about quantitative finance, determined to devote myself to it after graduation.
